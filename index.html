        <p>Hello everyone! I'm Angele and I want to share with you my exciting </p>
        <p>journey in the world of programming.Initially, my path was destined to</p>
        <p>be a graphic designer after completing my scientific bachelor's degree.</p>
        <p>However, life led me to discover the fascinating intersection between </p>
        <p>design and programming.</p> <br>

        <p>My exploration began with Java, HTML, CSS and XML, and I quickly</p>
        <p>realised the incredible potential I had when combining design with</p>
        <p>programming. This discovery opened the doors to a vast world </p>
        <p>of knowledge and creative opportunities.I am currently in my second year</p>

        <p>A key moment in my journey was attending the VDS event, where I had</p>
        <p>the privilege of meeting many programmers, both front-end and back-end</p>
        <p>Their dedication, perseverance and joy inspired me deeply,</p>
        <p>showing me that anything is possible with effort and a positive attitude.</p>

        <br>

        <p>As I move forward in my learning journey, I am excited about what the </p>
        <p>future holds for me. </p>
