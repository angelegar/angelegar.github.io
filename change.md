The changes I have made is a better html structure.
I have searched MDNlearn for information on how to make the colour change transitions.
Searched the internet to make the "Dark mode".
To be done:
Put photos and put a carousel with images of the projects.
Change colour when clicking on a word.
And animations with JavaScript
